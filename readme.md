# Bruhstrap:
A CSS-only, minimal Bootstrap-esque library focused on utility classes. 

## What is this?
I like Bootstrap a lot, but jQuery, Popper, and its own script seems like a bit too much JavaScript for my taste. To resolve my personal problem, I embarked on an expedition to create a JavaScript-free Bootstrap! I was really lazy with this project, so I wrote a super tiny Python script to compile/minify the CSS for me.

**Note:** I am aware of the existence of Bulma, but unfortunately I didn't like it as much as many people do (personal choice, please use Bulma guys).
